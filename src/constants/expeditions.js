    snippet: `
      I am interested in how climate change has shaped the evolutionary history of New World
      Swallowtail Butterflies. The museum specimens in this collection provide a detailed record of
      the geographical variation and distribution of butterfly species, with which I can better
      understand their history.

    snippet: `
      Megachilid (Leaf-cutter bees) bees are extraordinarily important plant pollinators known as
      leafcutter or mason bees, so named because they typically make their solitary nests using soil
      and leaves.

      This expedition features more images of trechine ground beetles from
      the E.H. Strickland Entomological Museum (University of Alberta Museums).
      The Trechinae is a subfamily within the Carabidae (ie. ground beetles).
      It contains the genus Bembidion, the largest genus of ground beetles
      with about 1250 species. Most species in this genus are small (<7.5 mm),
      and prefer cool, moist environments along bodies of water.
